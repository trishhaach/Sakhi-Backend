# PCOS/PCOD Detection Web Application

## Abstract

Sakhi is a web application designed to address Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and Polycystic Ovary Disease (PCOD), complex health issues that affect women worldwide. Early detection and effective management are crucial for ensuring well-being. Factors such as hormonal imbalances, family genetics, and environmental factors play a role. Symptoms vary widely, from excess facial hair to irregular periods and skin changes. Sakhi offers a user-friendly interface for input and prediction retrieval, addressing ethical concerns like data privacy. We are using different machine learning algorithms, and we will compare the results of every algorithm to provide an efficient method for the early prediction of PCOS/PCOD. The web application uses React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend to empower individuals and healthcare professionals in combating PCOS/PCOD.

## Problem Statement

In todayâ€™s rapidly changing world, the health and well-being of women, especially regarding menstrual health, often do not receive the attention they deserve. Despite advancements, many women face serious menstrual issues that significantly impact their health and quality of life.

- Many women with PCOD/PCOS are undiagnosed or diagnosed late due to lack of awareness and diverse symptoms.
- PCOD/PCOS diagnostic methods are costly and time-intensive, limiting access especially in low-resource places.

## Objectives

The main Goals and Objectives of our project can be listed as follows:

- Develop an intuitive and accessible web interface for users to input their health data.
- Set up a backend database to store user inputs and prediction results securely.
- Implement robust security measures to protect user data and maintain privacy.
- Design input forms to collect necessary health metrics and symptoms (e.g., menstrual cycle regularity, BMI, insulin resistance, etc.).

## Process

### Data Collection

- Data gathering includes gathering patient information from clinics, hospitals, medical records, and open databases, as well as medical history and clinical examinations.

### Data Preprocessing

- Data preprocessing involves cleaning up inconsistent data, identifying outliers, and missing numbers, selecting features, and normalizing or standardizing data as needed.

### Model Development

- Model development involves choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm, training the model, and optimizing its parameters.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js
- Machine Learning Libraries: TBD
